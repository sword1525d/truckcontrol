/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Frotacontrol application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model within a hierarchical data structure. Users can only access their own data, and data is organized by company and sector.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is structured as follows:
 * /companies/{companyId}
 * /companies/{companyId}/sectors/{sectorId}
 * /companies/{companyId}/sectors/{sectorId}/users/{userId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is nested under company and sector IDs, enabling path-based authorization.
 * - The userId (matricula) is used as the document ID for users, simplifying ownership checks.
 * - The rules explicitly prevent unauthorized data access at each level of the hierarchy.
